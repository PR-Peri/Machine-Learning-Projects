Hackathon Challenge 

The dataset couldn't be uploaded due to the size limit in Git. So, I have attached the link to the dataset

URL Link -> https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

After downloading the dataset from the source above, please rename the file to "credit.csv". 
To avoid errors when running the ipynb file, it is required to change the name of dataset file. 

SUMMARY ->
Step 1 - Download the dataset 
Step 2 - Change the dataset name to "credit.csv"
Step 3 - Open the Fraud_detection.ipynb
Step 4 - Set the path of the dir where you have downloaded and placed the dataset and ipynb files.
Step 5 - Run the code :)
