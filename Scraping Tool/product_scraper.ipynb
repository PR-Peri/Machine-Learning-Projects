    "## SCRAPING TOOL\n",
    "The goal is to automate the manual process of scraping by automating the collection of product media (images and videos) for items available on the H&M website.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> The script allows all the product media to be easily obtained without having to manually access or open the website. </li>\n",
    "<li> All media are placed into different subfolders of items. </li>\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Reason for choosing Selenium: </b>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p> Selenium is considered one of the best choices for scraping data from the H&M website for several reasons. Firstly, the H&M website is primarily built using JavaScript, which can make it difficult to scrape with traditional scraping tools. However, Selenium is capable of executing JavaScript code on a website, making it ideal for scraping dynamic websites like H&M.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Selenium provides a high level of automation, which is particularly useful when scraping large amounts of data from a website. With Selenium, you can automate the process of navigating to specific web pages, interacting with various elements, and extracting the desired data, all without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, Selenium offers a wide range of programming language support, making it accessible to developers with various programming backgrounds. This flexibility allows developers to choose a programming language that they are most comfortable with, making it easier to write and maintain the scraping code. </p>\n",
