498,b'@Mrs_Educate @mcoutts81 Any of my coding clubs when I taught in primary had more girls than boys too. In my ADE showcase in 2017 I shared about one 10 year old girl in particular who took to coding to much that her dream was to become a computer program when she grew up. #AppleEDUchat'

519,"b'@Mrs_Educate A3: my staff team is 100% female and everyone uses technology in the classroom, so we are all role models! One  of my teachers has just become an Apple  Teacher and the other is working towards it. All teachers &amp; assistants use iPad and Seesaw daily #AppleEDUchat'"
520,b'@mcoutts81 That\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting. I wonder if locality has an impact or age range...  #AppleEDUchat'
521,b'A3 I also find myself defending girls who behave like boys do - being assertive. Some consider this behaviour negative for a girl but positive for a boy. This is NOT cool. #AppleEDUchat'
522,b'A3 technology has always been a mainly male focussed industry. #girlswhocode is a big push for a lot of schools. Luckily I had a healthy spread of representation in my coding clubs. In fact it was attended more by girls. I think culturally there is a pendulum swing #AppleEDUChat https://t.co/JL24Uj2QMF'
523,"b'A3: Representation is also very important - Women, girls, men, and boys all need to see gender diversity in technology - girls as digital leaders and women in the IT department as both technical support &amp; EdTech #AppleEDUchat'"
524,b'@techclassrocks Do they join boys at point too. Interested in this myself...  #AppleEDUchat'
525,"b'@techclassrocks @philorch Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more #AppleEDUchat and in all arts \xf0\x9f\x8e\xad music, conductors and composers, film, directors, cinematographers, dance, choreography etc.'"
526,b'@jakobesben @MrsLauraW Wow! How amazing if you! Well done  #AppleEDUchat'
527,b'A3:  Conversations - open dialogue for starters.  \nAnd I \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f #GirlsWhoCode clubs!  Running a club has provided a safe place and opportunities for my girls to realize that they are capable of anything in a supportive environment! #AppleEDUchat https://t.co/EY1GHdvuA1'
528,b'A3 I advertise my coding &amp; ICT activities equally for boys and girls and try to give girls more voice as they tend to retreat in the class setting in favour of the louder boys. #AppleEDUchat'
529,"b'A3. I loved talking to children about Ada Lovelace, Mae Jemison and other inspirational women! We had a STEAM Week a couple of years back that was based on women in STEAM. My daughter is actually named after Ada Lovelace!\xf0\x9f\x99\x82 #AppleEDUchat'"
530,"b'Jumping in very late...Susan Maynor from Kansas City, MO #AppleEDUchat'"
531,b'@Mrs_Educate A3 By never assuming gender is a factor in why or how people use tech.  #AppleEDUchat'
532,"b'@MrsLauraW It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t planned or meant as a celebration but yesterday I managed to negotiate a better salary for all of our covid test personal.

534,b'A3 In Austria we are bound by law and societal expectation to at least show all genders in speech (using masc and fem nouns + pronouns - cumbersome but necessary cos some neglect this) so I do this in speech in class and when using examples and visual aids. #AppleEDUchat https://t.co/SuzhMbOL3O'

536,b'@mcoutts81 Your wife sounds like a good woman #AppleEDUchat I agree that everyday culture has greater impact than a once a year show'
537,b'@LyndseyBalfe @MrsLauraW It\xe2\x80\x99s such a shame. We can take positives but the pitfalls are there. Maybe later of next year! #AppleEDUchat'

541,b'A3: By being the change I want to see. Showing my passion for tech and what it can do! By showing and speaking about technology as positive for all. I often speak about all people and ADEs who have inspired me in the classroom too! #AppleEDUchat'
542,"b'@MirCWalsh It\xe2\x80\x99s about making some noise! Maybe a better question would of been, \xe2\x80\x9chow could your institution celebrate it?\xe2\x80\x9d #AppleEDUchat'"
543,b'@AmarjitMarva Love many religious leaders who broke away from the society to preach equality. One reason I love to teach it! #AppleEDUchat'
544,b'@MrsLauraW A2 No we had some plans but unfortunately lockdown got in the way and we lost track of the time to organise something. #AppleEDUChat'
545,b'A3: I believe #language is powerful! How you speak about #gender and #technology is one part of creating a culture in your classroom and school. If you speak about something as \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98expected\xe2\x80\x99 those who may think otherwise will slowly become the minority #AppleEDUchat'
