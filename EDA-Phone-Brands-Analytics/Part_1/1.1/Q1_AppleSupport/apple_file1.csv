b'@mcoutts81 That\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting. I wonder if locality has an impact or age range...  #AppleEDUchat'
b'A3 I also find myself defending girls who behave like boys do - being assertive. Some consider this behaviour negative for a girl but positive for a boy. This is NOT cool. #AppleEDUchat'
b'A3 technology has always been a mainly male focussed industry. #girlswhocode is a big push for a lot of schools. Luckily I had a healthy spread of representation in my coding clubs. In fact it was attended more by girls. I think culturally there is a pendulum swing #AppleEDUChat https://t.co/JL24Uj2QMF'
"b'A3: Representation is also very important - Women, girls, men, and boys all need to see gender diversity in technology - girls as digital leaders and women in the IT department as both technical support &amp; EdTech #AppleEDUchat'"
b'@techclassrocks Do they join boys at point too. Interested in this myself...  #AppleEDUchat'
"b'@techclassrocks @philorch Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more #AppleEDUchat and in all arts \xf0\x9f\x8e\xad music, conductors and composers, film, directors, cinematographers, dance, choreography etc.'"
b'@jakobesben @MrsLauraW Wow! How amazing if you! Well done  #AppleEDUchat'
b'A3:  Conversations - open dialogue for starters.  \nAnd I \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f #GirlsWhoCode clubs!  Running a club has provided a safe place and opportunities for my girls to realize that they are capable of anything in a supportive environment! #AppleEDUchat https://t.co/EY1GHdvuA1'
b'A3 I advertise my coding &amp; ICT activities equally for boys and girls and try to give girls more voice as they tend to retreat in the class setting in favour of the louder boys. #AppleEDUchat'
"b'A3. I loved talking to children about Ada Lovelace, Mae Jemison and other inspirational women! We had a STEAM Week a couple of years back that was based on women in STEAM. My daughter is actually named after Ada Lovelace!\xf0\x9f\x99\x82 #AppleEDUchat'"
"b'Jumping in very late...Susan Maynor from Kansas City, MO #AppleEDUchat'"
b'@Mrs_Educate A3 By never assuming gender is a factor in why or how people use tech.  #AppleEDUchat'
"b'@MrsLauraW It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t planned or meant as a celebration but yesterday I managed to negotiate a better salary for all of our covid test personal. They\xe2\x80\x99re as so many healthcare workers not well payed so it was fantastic to raise their salary with 17,5% \xf0\x9f\x98\x8a\n#AppleEDUchat'"
"b'@MrsLauraW A2: in my school, every \xe2\x80\x98madame ou mademoiselle\xe2\x80\x99 was gifted a beautiful tulip yesterday morning! \xf0\x9f\x8c\xb7#AppleEduChat'"
b'A3 In Austria we are bound by law and societal expectation to at least show all genders in speech (using masc and fem nouns + pronouns - cumbersome but necessary cos some neglect this) so I do this in speech in class and when using examples and visual aids. #AppleEDUchat https://t.co/SuzhMbOL3O'
"b'@MrsLauraW @Mrs_Educate @paulinelogue @runnerconroy @joy_ui @MirCWalsh @catherinem23 @BronwynWrites @pamelalamela Thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved learning new skills and working on renovating my house. #AppleEDUChat'"
b'@mcoutts81 Your wife sounds like a good woman #AppleEDUchat I agree that everyday culture has greater impact than a once a year show'
b'@LyndseyBalfe @MrsLauraW It\xe2\x80\x99s such a shame. We can take positives but the pitfalls are there. Maybe later of next year! #AppleEDUchat'
"b'Hello! Apologies for dropping in late, just finished off leading an Apple Teacher session on Numbers. Looking forward to catching up! #AppleEDUchat'"
"b'@Mrs_Educate @MrsLauraW Probably a young sports personality to highlight the commitment and resilience required to achieve, a real role model of today. Someone the ss may see on TV so they understand the person is real. #AppleEDUchat'"
b'A3. I think switching to a curriculum based on #EveryoneCanCreate definitely helped. I used to have mostly male students when it was just IT skills. Now it is creativity and technology we have ore of a mix. #AppleEDUchat'
b'A3: By being the change I want to see. Showing my passion for tech and what it can do! By showing and speaking about technology as positive for all. I often speak about all people and ADEs who have inspired me in the classroom too! #AppleEDUchat'
"b'@MirCWalsh It\xe2\x80\x99s about making some noise! Maybe a better question would of been, \xe2\x80\x9chow could your institution celebrate it?\xe2\x80\x9d #AppleEDUchat'"
b'@AmarjitMarva Love many religious leaders who broke away from the society to preach equality. One reason I love to teach it! #AppleEDUchat'
b'@MrsLauraW A2 No we had some plans but unfortunately lockdown got in the way and we lost track of the time to organise something. #AppleEDUChat'
b'A3: I believe #language is powerful! How you speak about #gender and #technology is one part of creating a culture in your classroom and school. If you speak about something as \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98expected\xe2\x80\x99 those who may think otherwise will slowly become the minority #AppleEDUchat'
b'@aliciabankhofer Love Montessori manipulatives! All ages need to use them #AppleEDUchat'
b'@aliciabankhofer I love the \xe2\x80\x98home\xe2\x80\x99 focus! We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go far to find amazing examples. #AppleEDUchat'
b'@Mrs_Educate A1- So many to mention (especially since I joined Twitter and followed some super inspiring educators on #AppleEduChat \xf0\x9f\x99\x83)... but the one that inspired me to become who I am today is my mum !\xf0\x9f\x92\x9e'
b'Q3: How do you promote gender equality and technology in your setting? #AppleEDUchat #IWD #InternationalWomensDay https://t.co/50VBoAn6Aq'

b'@catherinem23 I marvel at the strength these women had to have had #AppleEDUchat'
b'@mcoutts81 @Mrs_Educate This pretty much sums it up for me too. But gender equality is a big thing in our company of 2. 50% of personel is female \xf0\x9f\x98\x89 #AppleEDUchat'
"b'@Mrs_Educate Good question - I would have done a social media post on our school Instagram and hailed our female teachers and students and focused lessons on female heroes, making sure to mention diverse backgrounds. #AppleEDUchat'"
b'@catherinem23 @MrsLauraW Like that spin on the theme this year! Great stuff. How did you celebrate? #AppleEDUchat'
"b""@MrsLauraW @techclassrocks I don't think I've ever seen a female conductor now that I think of it.... Representation is so important for young women, if you can see it, you can be it! We had a STEAM week in school last wk &amp; I made sure to feature women role models etc for that reason #AppleEDUchat"""
b'@jakobesben You must be so proud of them both - one public and private - affecting their context in their own special ways #appleeduchat'
b'@AmarjitMarva @MrsLauraW Great idea to have a focus! Who would you pick? #AppleEDUchat'
"b""@MrsLauraW I love that the Asst. Conductor of the @philorch is Erina Yashima!  It's so important for our girls to be able to see themselves in these roles and realize of course it's possible! #AppleEDUchat"""

b'A2 Unfortunately not at all. :( There was a big demo in Vienna but our school doesn\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate things like this. What did you guys do? #AppleEDUchat'
b'@Mrs_Educate A2 cont. my mum whom I want to make proud. We\xe2\x80\x99ve always been close. Only child &amp; my dad worked offshore so was just us a lot of the time and a daughter who I want to make a powerful dent in the world. And I never forget to tell her to be awesome.

"b""@MrsLauraW A2: this year it was our 1st day back to in class teaching on IWD, so we didn't do anything big - staff were offered non contact time to attend online well-being sessions if they wanted to, most did and said it was really useful. My staff team is 100% women! #AppleEDUchat"""
b'A2 well right now I\xe2\x80\x99m an institution of 1 &amp; tbh I don\xe2\x80\x99t need one day to celebrate the women in my life. My wife doesn\xe2\x80\x99t let me give up.

"b'@MrsLauraW Agree. She was pretty badass. AND her work is still valid today. And NOT ONLY for primary, if you ask me :) #AppleEDUchat'"
b'@MrsLauraW A2 This year we are celebrating those women who #ChooseToChallenge in the area of maths. Women like Florence Nightingale who pushed the boundaries in statistics as well as nursing #AppleEduChat\n\nhttps://t.co/P7mq0i4tCM'
"b'@techclassrocks I remember seeing an Australian female conductor on TV and thinking, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a girl... #appleeduchat'"
b'@MrsLauraW Her composure and delivery is breath taking. Away from education we run an AV company and get involved with some amazing projects. #AppleEdUchat'
"b'@pamelalamela In the current circumstances especially,nurses and doctors deserve all the respect we can give them #AppleEDUchat'"
"b'@Mrs_Educate These 2 definitely do. There\xe2\x80\x99s 23mo between them and I think one of the reasons shes so determined is because she\xe2\x80\x99s been given the chance to shine. Her big brother dotes on her, she knows what it means to be listened to, loved but can also hold her own. #AppleEDUChat'"
